### 🎮 Zedicus 

**`(Student/Indie Game Developer)`**

💻 This is my main account.

🎲 Here you can see the projects that I made in my spare time. Right now, most of them are Unity games, but I plan to make a few more low-level ones, like a rendering engine or some simple C++ game.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Zedicus Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my career as a software development student, learning Unity and game development at the same time. After I realised that the place where I was studying would not provide me with the necessary knowledge, I dropped out after 2.5 years of study and moved to another city, where I entered a private educational institution, where I learned all the technologies mentioned above. I am currently finishing my studies at this place and will be submitting my diploma thesis. At the same time, I continue to study GameDev, now I am learning Unreal Engine.
